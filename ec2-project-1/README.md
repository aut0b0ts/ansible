## Dive into Automation with Ansible

Welcome to your first Ansible project! Whether you're a complete beginner or looking to solidify your foundational knowledge, this repository is designed to guide you through practical, hands-on experience with Ansible. 

## Project: Setting Up a Web Server with Ansible

### Objective
Automate the deployment and configuration of a web server (Nginx) on a remote server using Ansible.

### Prerequisites
1. **Basic Knowledge**: A very basic understanding of SSH and command-line usage.
2. **Remote Server**: A virtual machine or cloud instance (e.g., AWS EC2) with SSH access.
3. **Ansible Installed**: Ansible installed on your local machine. [How to Install Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html)

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### Step 1: Set Up Your Ansible Inventory

First, let's define the hosts where you want to deploy the web server.

1. **Create a Directory for Your Project**:

   ```sh
   mkdir ansible-webserver-setup
   cd ansible-webserver-setup
   ```

2. **Create an Inventory File**:

   ```sh
   nano inventory
   ```

3. **Add the Server Details**:
   
   Replace `your_server_ip` with the actual IP address of your remote server and `your_username` with your SSH username. For Ubuntu servers, the default user is often `ubuntu`.

   ```ini
   [webservers]
   your_server_ip ansible_user=your_username ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/your_private_key
   ```

#### Step 2: Create an Ansible Playbook

Next, create a playbook that defines the tasks for setting up and configuring the web server.

1. **Create a Playbook File**:

   ```sh
   nano site.yml
   ```

2. **Add the Playbook Content**:

   ```yaml
   ---
   - hosts: webservers
     become: yes
     tasks:
       - name: Install Nginx
         apt:
           name: nginx
           state: present
           update_cache: yes

       - name: Start and enable Nginx service
         systemd:
           name: nginx
           state: started
           enabled: yes

       - name: Copy custom index.html to web server
         copy:
           src: files/index.html
           dest: /var/www/html/index.html
           owner: www-data
           group: www-data
           mode: '0644'
   ```

#### Step 3: Create a Custom HTML File

Create an HTML file to be served by the Nginx web server.

1. **Create a Directory for Files**:

   ```sh
   mkdir files
   ```

2. **Create the `index.html` File**:

   ```sh
   nano files/index.html
   ```

3. **Add HTML Content**:

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
       <title>Welcome to Ansible Web Server!</title>
   </head>
   <body>
       <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
       <p>This web server is configured using Ansible.</p>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

#### Step 4: Run the Ansible Playbook

Run the playbook to deploy and configure the web server on your remote host.

```sh
ansible-playbook -i inventory site.yml
```

#### Step 5: Verify the Deployment

1. Open your web browser.
2. Navigate to `http://your_server_ip`.
3. You should see the custom HTML page served by Nginx.

### Additional Enhancements

Once you have completed the basic setup, you can enhance your project by:

1. Adding more tasks to install and configure other services.
2. Using Ansible roles to organize your playbooks.
3. Implementing more complex configurations with templates and handlers.
4. Setting up SSL with Let's Encrypt.
